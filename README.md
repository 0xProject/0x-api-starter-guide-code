# Getting started with 0x API

This is a repo containing code snippets to interact with 0x API through smart contracts
or with web3. A number of the code snippets have corresponding guides that provides
color to what is happening in the snippets.

## Finding finished code snippets
On `master` branch all of the snippets are empty and will require following the guides
to complete them; to find the finished snippets, check out the `finished` branch. 

## Running the snippets
Before running the scripts run:
```
$ yarn 
```

```
$ yarn build:contracts
```

This codebase uses `ts-node` to run the typescript code-snippets.

## Snippets
All code snippets can be found in either `examples/` or `contracts/` (dependent to if there is any smart contract code needed for the snippet)
